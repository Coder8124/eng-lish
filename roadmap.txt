1) set up language grammatical rules & syntax. Shouldnt be too hard since its in english, but we might have to make choices, such as do we accept antonyms and how to define a function and whatnot

2) Set up lexer and LLVM

steps(according to ai): 

Define syntax and semantics (grammar, operators, control flow, data types):
Start with a simple language concept (like an expression calculator or a tiny functional language).

Lexical Analysis (Lexing):

Write a lexer to tokenize the source code (split the code into meaningful tokens like identifiers, keywords, operators).
This can be done using simple string parsing or lexer generators.

Parsing:

Implement a parser to convert tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
Use recursive descent parsing or operator precedence parsing for expressions.
The AST is a structured representation of the source code.

Semantic Analysis:
Check for semantic errors (e.g., type checking, variable declarations).
collect symbol tables and scope information.

LLVM IR Generation:
Traverse the AST and generate LLVM IR instructions using LLVM's API.
LLVM IR is a low-level, SSA-based intermediate language.
Use LLVM classes such as llvm::Module, llvm::IRBuilder, and llvm::LLVMContext in C++ to create modules, functions, and instructions.
You can generate instructions for arithmetic, memory operations, control flow statements (if, loops), and function calls.

JIT or Static Compilation:
LLVM supports Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation allowing immediate execution of IR.
Alternatively, generate object code or executable files using LLVM's optimization and code generation passes.

Extending the Language:
Add support for user-defined variables, functions, control flow, and custom operators.
Implement features like conditionals (if), loops (for), and more complex types (arrays, structs).
