Translations: (Python to Eng-Lish)

will be statically typed, especially for variables!!!

print() = output:
return = function output
types:
str = text
int = standard number
float = decimal
list = list
dictionary = lock and key list
tuple = fixed list
set = unique collection
boolean = true or false

signifier?: of statement, which acts like a bridge
e.g converting string(text) to int(standard number) =  standard number of text
in python this would be (int(insidestring))


variable declaration:

"let" keyword: initalizes the variable definition
"with value" keyword: same function as the = sign in python, tells the computer what value this has
sample var dec(eng-lish): let varname be a decimal with value 3.74
sample var dec(python): varname = 3.74


Operations:

+ -> add (always outputs a decimal)
- -> subtract (always outputs a decimal)
/ -> divide (always outputs a decimal)
% -> remainder (always outputs a standard number)
// -> quotient (always outputs a standard number)
"to" and "value" -> assignment operator
== -> same
!= -> not equal

example sentence(operations):
python: varname += 6
eng-lish: Add 6 to varname.

conditional statements:
If <condition> then <action>

python          to            eng-lish:
if a!= 5:                    If a is not equal to 5 then
...                          ...



sentence ender: .

goal: no sentences longer than 15-20 words, then it becomes hard to read & understand




example sentence:
print("Hello World") = output
